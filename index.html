    <h1>Shu-Ha-Ri</h1>
    <p>The mental model "Shu-Ha-Ri" is a concept from Japanese martial arts that can be applied to the process of learning and development in various fields. It roughly translates to "to keep, to fall, to break away" which refers to the three stages of mastery. Shu-Ha-Ri can be decomposed into three kanjis:

    Shu(守) - "protect"/"obey": In the first stage, the learner follows the already established rules and procedures. The main focus lies on acquiring knowledge and skills by following the teachings of a master or mentor, and establishing good habits.

    Ha(破) - "detach"/"digress": In the middle stage, the learner begins to experiment and deviate from established rules. The focus is on discovering new approaches, testing boundaries, and challenging assumptions.

    Ri(離) - "leave"/"seperate": In the final stage, the learner transcends established rules and creates their own unique style. The focus is on mastery, creativity, and self-expression. This kanji is also understood as "the opening of a bird's cage that will achieve greatness through persevering".

Although the concept was mainly used in Japanese Martial Arts the idea can be projected onto our daily lifes and into various fields, including software development, design and education. We as learners must pass through each stage in order to reach true mastery and creativity. The model emphasizes the importance of discipline and structure in the early stages, followed by experimentation and exploration, and finally, the development of a personal style.</p>
